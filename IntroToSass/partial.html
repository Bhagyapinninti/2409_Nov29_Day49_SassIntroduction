    <p>You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass
         files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain.
         A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. </p>
